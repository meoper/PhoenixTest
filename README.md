# PhoenixTest
## General notes
* The overall solution is simplistic and has many things missing to represent a proper structure
* I have not added unit test, as in my opinion they should test domain level logic, which is not really present in this task. While integration tests would fit the bill, they require more time investment to set up properly
* There is a typo in the name of the project... noticed that one too late
* There is an endpoint for user generation, as the database is empty by default
* Swagger is enabled, although did not do any extra configuration for it

## Running instructions
* Create an MSSQL DB 
* Add correct conncetion string to configutaion file
* Run project
* Activate endpoints using something (postman or other)
